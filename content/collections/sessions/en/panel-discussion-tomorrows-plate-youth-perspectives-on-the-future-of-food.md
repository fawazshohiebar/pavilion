<p>From lab to lunchbox, the next generation is redefining what we eat and how we make it. This youth-led panel explores new food careers, the psychology behind trying novel foods, and how innovation in health, sport, and sustainability can shape a cleaner, smarter food future. Four students from different disciplines share how their generation plans to feed the world of tomorrow.</p><p>Led by the United Arab Emirates University</p><p>Dr Fawzi Banat</p>
