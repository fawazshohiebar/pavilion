<p>The panel will explore how international collaboration among collaborating centers, reference laboratories, and research institutes contributes to improved livestock health, disease control, and food security. By connecting expertise, data, and innovation, these networks enable countries to enhance diagnostic capacity, harmonize surveillance systems, and translate research into actionable policies. The session will also highlight successful models of collaboration and lessons learned from ongoing initiatives.</p>
