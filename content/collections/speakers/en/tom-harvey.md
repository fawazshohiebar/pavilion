Tom has enjoyed a 23-year career in food retail. He moved to the UAE to join Spinneys Commercial team in 2017 after working across the buying teams of several of the leading supermarket groups in UK.

As part of Spinneys' Executive Leadership Team, Tom leads the overall sourcing and product function for the group with responsibility for a team spread across four continents to source and develop all the products for Spinneys and Waitrose stores across UAE, Oman and KSA.

During his eight years at Spinneys Tom supported the 2024 IPO of the business on the Dubai Financial Market and was responsible for the creation of the Spinneys Local Business Incubator Programme which is now in its sixth year of supporting UAE SMEs and microbusiness to launch into retail. Under Tom’s stewardship Spinneys private label brand share and overall market share have grown to record levels. He implemented the first supplier conference programme hosted by any UAE food retailer which helped Spinneys to now be ranked by multi-national suppliers as the best Supermarket group in the UAE by the global Advantage Group survey.
